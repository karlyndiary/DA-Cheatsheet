### ALLNOBLANKROW() 
- ALLNOBLANKROW performs the same functions of ALL, but it does not return the blank row generated by the DAX engine when an invalid relationship is detected.
- ALLNOBLANKROW still returns blanks, if they are present among the regular rows of the table. The only blank ignored is the one in the blank row.
