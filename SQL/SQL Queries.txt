1. Write down the query to print the first letter of the store in Upper Case and all other letter in Lower Case.
```
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(customer_name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(customer_name, 2, LENGTH(customer_name)))) as stores
FROM atliq.customers
```
+---------------------------+
|       Store Name          |
+---------------------------+
|       Surge stores        |

+---------------------------+
|       Premium stores      |
+---------------------------+
|       Nomad stores        |
+---------------------------+

2. Write down the query to display all employee name in one cell seprated by ',' ex:-"Vikas, nikita, Ashish, Nikhil , Danish"
```
select concat(group_concat(customer_name separator ', ')) as customer_names
from atliq.customers
```
customer_names
-------------------------------
Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, Surface Stores, Premium Stores, Electricalsara Stores, Info Stores, Acclaimed Stores, Electricalsquipo Stores, Atlas Stores, 
Flawless Stores, Integration Stores, Unity Stores, Forward Stores, Electricalsbea Store...

3. Write down the query to retrieve the customer_name and the respective customer_name values, where multiple customers of the same type are listed in the same cell separated by commas.
```
SELECT customer_name,  GROUP_CONCAT(customer_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS customer_name
FROM atliq.customers
GROUP BY customer_type;
```

4. You have a table(FuelDetail) with ID, Fuel, And Date columns.
--Fuel column is contain fuel quantity at a particular time when car start traveling. So we need to find out
that when the driver fill Petrol in his/her car.
--By FuelDetail Table image on the top of this post, you can understand the query.
--Car start driving at 10 Am on 25th April with petrol(10 liter)
--at 11 AM Petrol was 9 liters
--at 12 AM petrol was 8 liters
--at 2 PM (14) petrol was 12 liters...
--This means that he/she fill the petrol at 25th April 2014 at 2PM
--Next time he fill petrol at 7PM 25th April 2014
--and Next time he fill petrol at 11PM 25th April 2014
```
SELECT c1.fuel AS `Fuel quantity Now`, c1.`Date`, c.fuel AS `Fuel quantity Before`, c.`Date`
FROM FuelDetail c
JOIN FuelDetail c1 ON c1.`Date` = (
    SELECT MIN(`Date`) 
    FROM FuelDetail 
    WHERE `Date` > c.`Date`
)
WHERE c1.fuel > c.fuel;
```
