4. You have a table(FuelDetail) with ID, Fuel, And Date columns.
--Fuel column is contain fuel quantity at a particular time when car start traveling. So we need to find out
that when the driver fill Petrol in his/her car.
--By FuelDetail Table image on the top of this post, you can understand the query.
--Car start driving at 10 Am on 25th April with petrol(10 liter)
--at 11 AM Petrol was 9 liters
--at 12 AM petrol was 8 liters
--at 2 PM (14) petrol was 12 liters...
--This means that he/she fill the petrol at 25th April 2014 at 2PM
--Next time he fill petrol at 7PM 25th April 2014
--and Next time he fill petrol at 11PM 25th April 2014
```
SELECT c1.fuel AS `Fuel quantity Now`, c1.`Date`, c.fuel AS `Fuel quantity Before`, c.`Date`
FROM FuelDetail c
JOIN FuelDetail c1 ON c1.`Date` = (
    SELECT MIN(`Date`) 
    FROM FuelDetail 
    WHERE `Date` > c.`Date`
)
WHERE c1.fuel > c.fuel;
```

5. Suppose that you have table Employee with a column EName which contain
Records Employee name(EName) as A,B,A,A,B,D,C,M,A, Write a query which will
change/Swap the EName A to B and B to A.
```
UPDATE Employee
set EName = (CASE
WHEN EName='A' THEN 'B'
WHEN EName='B' THEN 'A'
ELSE EName
END)
```

6. Write a query to create a clone of existing table.
```
CREATE TABLE customer_data2.cust_address SELECT * FROM customer_data2.customer_address WHERE 1=0; -> clones only the structure
CREATE TABLE customer_data2.cust_add SELECT * FROM customer_data2.customer_address -> clones the structure and data
```
