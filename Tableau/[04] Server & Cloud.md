WHERE TO SHARE?
- It should be secure, scalable, robust and fast

To build this, we have two tableau products: server and cloud

Three hosting options: On-Prem, Iaas, SaaS

On server and cloud, you can:
- Share links to users to access the dashboard without installing any software and can be viewed on the web browser.
- You can give the users different roles [Admin/ Creator/ Explorer/ Viewer] and add them to groups.
- Automate tasks: You can schedule to refresh data sources.
- Depending on the role, the user can even start creating dashboards directly on the web browser.
