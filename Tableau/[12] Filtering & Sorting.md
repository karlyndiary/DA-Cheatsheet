- Filter means removing or selecting specific data subsets for different purposes and use cases.
- Use Case
  - Reduce the size of the dataset to optimize performance
  - Interactivity and analysis by offering filters to users.
  - Data Security by removing sensitive data.
  - Data Access Control by applying RLS (Row Level Security)
- Filter Type
  - Optimize & Performance
    - Extract Filer
      - Filter between the source system and data source 
    - Data Source Filter
      - Filter between the data source and the worksheet
    - Context Filter
      - Filter on the worksheet
  - Interactivity: Offer on the Dashboard
    - Dimension Filter
    - Measure Filter

| Feature                  | Normal Filter                                  | Context Filter                                           |

| **Filter Order**         | Applied independently; each filter acts on the entire dataset | Applied first, creating a subset of data for other filters |
| **Effect on Other Filters** | No effect on other filters                 | Limits data for all subsequent filters                    |
| **Use Case**             | General filtering                             | Dependent filtering; improves performance with large datasets |
| **Performance Impact**   | May slow down with multiple complex filters   | Can enhance performance by reducing data processed by other filters |
| **Typical Example**      | Filtering for a single region or category     | Filtering a specific region as a context before applying further category filters |

- The filters affect all the worksheets
- Data Source Filter
  - Data Source Tab -> Filter -> Add -> Select the field -> Select the rows to exclude -> Click on exclude -> Click ok -> Click ok
- Context Filter
  - Filter on the worksheet
  - Context filters don't help protect sensitive data -> The show filter option also has the option to list all the values in the database
- Dimension Filter
  - Click on the down arrow -> Show Filter
- Measure Filter
  - Click on the down arrow -> Show Filter. Check the aggregation of the field and choose the same from the menu.
- Table Calculation Filter
  - Click the down arrow -> Quick Table Calculation -> Aggregation -> Ctrl + field to filters -> Show Filter

- Apply one filter to multiple visualizations or worksheets
  - Click on the drop-down arrow -> Apply to worksheets -> 4 Options
  - Only this worksheet is the default option for the filter

- All values in the Database
  - Shows all possible values from the database, regardless of other filters or contexts applied.
- All values in Context
  - Shows values filtered by the context filter if one is applied. Any values that donâ€™t meet the context filter criteria are excluded from this list.
- Only Relevant Values
  - Shows only the values that are relevant based on the current view or visualization filters. This is dynamic and updates based on selections or filters currently applied to the visualization.

- Higher level dimensions in the hierarchy will affect the lower level dimension and not vice versa.

- Tips
  - Avoid using "Only Relevant values"
    - All Values in Database: 1 Initial Query
    - Only Relevant Values: Multiple Queries for each interaction
  - Avoid using dimensions with high cardinality as a quick filter
    - The columns are long and have numerous rows of data.
    - Use columns that are of category kind.
  - Use wildcard match for high cardinality
    - For product names where the values are unique and long
  - Use the Apply button
    - Each click in the quick filter is a query
  - Minimize the number of quick filters
  - Arrange the filters in the proper order
  - Don't use "All" in the filters where it has low cardinality

- Convert date to continuous and keep it as a range filter
