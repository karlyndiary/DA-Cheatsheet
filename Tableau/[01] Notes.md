- Internet of Things (IOT)
  - Connecting any thing to the internet to exchange data
- Big Data
  - Any device connected to the internet is sending out data. Each click is data. 
  - 3 V's to indicate its Big Data
  - Volume: Millions of millions of rows of data. Data is now curated in MB, GB, TG, PB.
  - Velocity: For normal data processing, use the process slow data or batch data. For big data workloads, the sources are generating streams of data at a very high speed. This means we have to process and analyze the data in real time and then we store it in memory.
  - Variety: Data comes in different forms, structured [Excel, Database], Semi-Structured [XML, Websites], Unstructured [Video, Image]
  - Big Data means how we can efficiently store, process and analyse our data when it has huge volume, high speed and different types.

- Data Architecture
  - It is the process of creating a blueprint for how we organize, process and store our data into different layers for different purposes so that architecture makes it easier to manage, protect and access the data.
- Data Engineering
  - It is a complex process of designing and building data pipelines and data storage. It includes ETL processes to extract the raw data from multiple sources, and then transform it and load it to the storage in order to make it highly available and usable.
- Data Modelling
  - It is the process of connecting the dots between multiple entities to make a connection and build relationships between them.
- Data Mining
  - It is the process of analysing massive amounts of raw data in order to discover knowledge, to discover business intelligence like patterns and trends, to solve problems and to mitigate risks. 
- Machine Learning
  - We are providing raw and historical data, together with mathematical models and algorithms. This can then provide predictions upon training. 
- Data Visualization
  - Convert raw data into bar charts, pie charts, and more to make the raw data easier to understand. This helps in making decisions

- **Excel**
  - Data can be stored up to a million rows.
  - Manually needs to be refreshed.
- **Tableau**
  - Can handle more than millions of rows of data.
  - Can schedule refresh data time.
  - Row-level security and user security.
  - Multiple data sources.
