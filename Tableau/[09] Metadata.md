After loading the data to the data source, tableau will now start analysing the content of the data to make assumptions about the datatype and roles.
- Data Types [Operation Calculation]
  - Basic Types
    - Whole Numbers
    - Decimal Numbers
    - String [Text]
    - Date
    - Date & Time
    - Boolean [True or False]
  - 
- Role I
  - Dimension: Level of Detail 
  - Measure: Aggregation
- Role II
  - Discrete [Separate Values]
  - Continuous [Connected Values]

- The primary key should be of the same data type. [Tableau would indicate if the datatypes don't match]
- You can change the data type on the data source page or the worksheet page.
