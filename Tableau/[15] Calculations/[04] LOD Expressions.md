- How it works?
  - Aggregate the rows at the dimension level used in the calculation
  - Level of Details is the LOD Expression
  - The calculations are performed on the data within the data source
  - Results will be calculated on the FLY
- Syntax: {Fixed | Include | Exclude List of Dimensions : Aggregation}
- Static
  - Fixed
    - {Fixed [Category] : SUM([Sales])}
    - {Fixed [Category], [Product Name]: SUM([Sales])}
    - It works similarly to group by and aggregate in SQL. Groups by category and returns the sum of sales.
    - The values calculated here won't change even with the change in filters
    - Two Types of LOD:
      - One mentioned in the view is LOD (VIZ)
      - One mentioned in the calculated field is LOD (Expression)
    - Use Case:
      - Customer Order Frequency: Show the description of customers by number of orders.
- Dynamic
  - Include
    - The INCLUDE Level of Detail (LOD) expression in Tableau calculates an aggregation by including additional dimensions, regardless of whether they are present in the current view or visualization.
    - The "include" function includes the specified dimension in the calculation, making it dependent on the dimensions present in the view.
    - {Include [Category] : SUM([Sales])}
  - Exclude
    - Calculate the aggregation, excluding the dimension.
    - {Exclude [Category] : SUM([Sales])}
