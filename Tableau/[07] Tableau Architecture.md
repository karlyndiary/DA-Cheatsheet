      - 90 Connectors
    - Access Information will be stored inside the data source
      - Path of the file
      - Access Token
      - Database location
      - Username and password and more
    - Connection Type
      - Extract
      - Live
    - Data Model
      - Join tables together using joins, relationships and unions.
    - Visualizations
      - Tableau organizes the viz in three levels
        - Worksheets: These worksheets can also be created using two data sources[Extract and live] together called Data Blending
  - Server
    - 
  - Consumer
    - Workbook to consumers: .twbx
    - Workbook to Dev Team: .hyper, .tdsx, .twbx, .tds, .twb

  - Server Publish
    - The workbook with the extracted data to be published is sent to the gateway as a .twbx file, which contains both the data and the associated XML metadata.
    - This .twbx file is transmitted to the application server.
    - The XML file within the workbook stores the metadata of the workbook and is then sent to the repository.
    - The .hyper file, which contains the actual data, is sent to the file store for storage.

  - Authentication Process
    - The user logs into the system using their username and password.
    - This action sends a login request to the authentication server.
    - The authentication server checks the selected repository to verify if the user has permission to access the requested file.

  - Access View Process
    - User Login: The user accesses Tableau Server via a web browser and enters their login credentials (username and password).
    - Authentication: The credentials are sent to the authentication server, which verifies the userâ€™s identity using a specified method (e.g., Active Directory, SAML, or local authentication).
    - Authorization Check: Once authenticated, the server checks the user's permissions in the repository to determine access rights for specific workbooks, data sources, or dashboards.
    - Access Granted: If authorized, the user can access and interact with approved content on Tableau Server based on their permission level (such as viewer, editor, or admin).
    - Session Management: Tableau Server manages the user session, ensuring secure access and compliance with any additional security protocols during the session.
